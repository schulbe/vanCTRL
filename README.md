# vancontrol
## Purpose of this project
I bought an empty van a few years back and converted it to a camper. Since I was a student, I was dependend on
using as little money as possible to do so. After some years of camping I noticed tow major issues that annoyed me:
1. I never knew how much power was generated by my solar panel or used by my devices and had tehrefore
no idea how much I had left to use in my battery. It is thus hard to plan ahead when camping off the grid.
1. The biggest drain on my battery is my fridge which just knows the setting "very very cold" and "off".
To reduce power consumption significantly it would be good to have some sort of smart device switching it on and off 
dependend on measured temperature (or power left in the battery or alike)

Devices that can do all this do exist but they are not cheap. I therefore decided to build one of my own using a
RaspberryPi that I had lying around.

## General Remarks
* The solution I chose is highly specific and will most likely not be useable "as is" for anyone else,
 but it might present some ideas.
* It is a work in progress that I did not have too much time to work on during the past

## REMEMBER:
sudo crontab -e 

## Config Files

## Communication Interface
### General
Every Message sent starts with an indicator of what the message contains (in numerical Code):
- COMMAND_FLAG: Followed by further instructions of what to do 
- DATA_FLAG: Followed by Information

### COMMAND
A Full command looks like this:

\u0002COMMAND_FLAG\u0003COMMAND\u003[{details if needed}]\u0002

#### COMMAND = CMD_SWITCH_ON
details=SWITCH_NUMBER (get from config screen later, now from config file)
SWITCH_NUMBER is between 1 and 8

#### COMMAND = CMD_SWITCH_OFF
details=SWITCH_NUMBER (get from config screen later, now from config file)
SWITCH_NUMBER is between 1 and 8

#### COMMAND = CMD_SWITCH_TOGGLE
details=SWITCH_NUMBER (get from config screen later, now from config file)
SWITCH_NUMBER is between 1 and 8

#### COMMAND = CMD_SEND_DATA
details=DATA_TYPE
DATA_TYPE is one of (POWER_MEASUREMENT, TEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT, SWITCH_STATUS)

### DATA
\u0002DATA_FLAG\u0003DATA_TYPE\u0003DATA\u0002

#### DATA_TYPE = POWER_MEASUREMENT
DATA = IN_1_AMPERE\u0004IN_1_VOLT\u0004IN_2_AMPERE\u0004IN_2_VOLT\u0004IN_3_AMPERE\u0004IN_3_VOLT\u0004

#### DATA_TYPE = TEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT

#### DATA_TYPE = SWITCH_STATUS
DATA = STATUS_SWITCH_1\u0004STATUS_SWITCH_2\u0004....\u0004STATUS_SWITCH_8
